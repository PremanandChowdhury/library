// Dynamic Programming - Kadane's Algorithm

// find the subarray with maximum sum and return its sum
const input = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4];

// To find the subarray with the maximum sum, we can use Kadane's Algorithm. It's an efficient algorithm that runs in 𝑂(𝑛) time and is well-suited for this problem.
